# tviburar
...is a dual lane four step polyrythmic sequencer where each step contains a free running lfo that will generate notes.
the lfo modes are, square, random, ramp up, ramp down and sine. the steps can also be muted.
the two sequencers can influence each others lfo values creating a complex environment where the rate of repetition is stretched out over a long, near infinite, timespace.

performance tweaks are accessible from the main screen.

E1 - scrolls through the lfos (alt. switches between the sequencer lanes)

E2 - scrolls through the lfo settings (alt. scrolls through the lane settings)

E3 - adjust selected value

K1/K2/K3 are held (choose your preference) as "alt." to change lanes and lane settings.

tviburar is a script for monome norns, written by Filip Forsstr√∂m (@ljudvagg) and Linus Schrab (@vicimity).
The script is based on an original concept built by Filip for the Nord Modular G2.
